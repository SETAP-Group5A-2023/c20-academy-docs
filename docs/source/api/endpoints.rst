Endpoints
=========

All endpoints are relative to the API's domain name, in the case of the official API, :code:`api.c20.academy`.
Each endpoint corresponds to a single data type, and parameters should be passed as URL-encoded query parameters, e.g. :code:`/v1/article?id=1`.

.. note::

  All endpoints are currently at version 1, but this may change in the future. If an endpoint stops responding, check back here in case there is a new version.
