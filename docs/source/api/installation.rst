Installation
============

The recommended platform for the API is Fedora 39, as this is what it is tested against

#. Install PostgreSQL, e.g. `Fedora Docs <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/postgresql/>`_
#. Setup SSL encryption within Postgres
#. Set a username and password for the API to access the database
#. Use the `db_create.sql` file to setup the database and tables in Postgres
